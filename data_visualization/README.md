Live demo: http://www-scf.usc.edu/~liuxinyu/proposal_XinYue_Liu/index.html

This project is the proposal demo for displaying survey data that contains psychological scores for survey participants, which belongs to the Computational Social Sciences Lab (CSSL) of USC.

The website is to provide users easy access to this data. User is able to visualize the spatial distribution of the marginal scores as well as whichever joint scores they are interested in. People should also be able to generate secondary graphs (and tables of the data underlying such graphs). For example, user is able to plot a histogram of specific scores. That is, the user should be able to generate a histogram of scores across gender and they should be able to add other conditional information to this histogram. 

All elements are dynamic and interactive and user is able to save them directly from the website. 


This demo contains three subpages, each of them satisfied different functions. There is a note session in each page to describe its implementations.

Home Webpage:
1. Visualize all state data by bar chart
2. Visualize all state data by map chart, click to view city data (can be drilldown to county-level)
3. Basic summary of data modification.

Charts Webpage:
1. generate secondary graphs (each state's graph)
2. All graph can be saved directly from the website.
3. All graph can be in multiple formats, such as pie chart, line chart, bar chart, etc.

Tables Webpage:
1. search, 
2. refresh, 
3. add/remove properties, 
4. download query result as TXT/HTML/CVS file
